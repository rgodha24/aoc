# Advent Of Code

## Advent of code done in typescript.

(ik typescript is a mickey mouse language but this is fun)

This repo is set up as a pnpm workspace with Turborepo. For each day of advent of code, a new folder is created. In this folder, vitest is setup to run tests on file changes. 


Notes: 

This is my first time with TDD and it's been very nice, especially for some of the harder problems where i can test functions much more easily. 
tsx has been very weird for me idk why
